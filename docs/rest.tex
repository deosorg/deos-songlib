You can generate a period of silence with the {\it rest} function,
which
takes a beat count as an argument.
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    rest(W);
\end{verbatim}

would generate four beats of silence under 4:4 time.
One can also rest for some number of measures, by using
the measuresToBeats conversion function. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    rest(measuresToBeats(3));
\end{verbatim}

would rest for three measures or, under 4:4 time, twelve beats.
