\section*{Mac installation instructions}

Begin the installation process by downloading the \songlib\ source
tarball into a directory named {\it songlib}:

\begin{verbatim}
    mkdir ~/songlib
    cd ~/songlib
    curl -O beastie.cs.ua.edu/songlib/songlib-1.47.tgz
\end{verbatim}

Then, unpack the tarball:

\begin{verbatim}
    tar xvfz *.tgz
\end{verbatim}

If \verb!/usr/local/bin/! is not in your path, then you
should add it. See the web for instructions on how to add
a directory to the \verb!PATH! environment variable.

Create the \verb!/usr/local/bin/! directory, if it doesn't already exist:

\begin{verbatim}
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
\end{verbatim}

Move into the {\it songlib} directory and then
into {\it mac} directory and install {\it wget}:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd ~/songlib/mac
    chmod +x wget
    sudo cp wget /usr/local/bin
\end{verbatim}

If you want to use additional songlib instrument sample packs,
install {\it flac}:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd ~/songlib/mac
    open flac-1.2.1.dmg
\end{verbatim}

Open up the {\it flac} folder on your desktop, double click on the installation
icon, and follow the instructions.

At the bottom of the file \verb!~/.bash_profile!, add the lines:

\begin{verbatim}
    export WAVPLAYER=afplay
    export PATH=~/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH:.
\end{verbatim}

Log out of your computer and log in again
for these changes to go into effect.

Finally, build and install the library, build and install the utilities,
and install the default sample note files by typing the command:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo make install
\end{verbatim}

while in the {\it songlib} directory.

To test your installation, move into the {\it quickstart} directory and
type {\it make play}:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd quickstart
    make
    make play
\end{verbatim}

You should see the song being constructed and then should hear it
begin to play.
