Songlib has been expanded to support the random selection of notes from multiple
channel samples in order to create a more realistic sound. This feature is disabled
by default. See documentation on rcombine/runcombine for information on how to 
create multiple channeled samples for use with this feature.

Commands connected to random channel selection:

setRandomChannel(int mode)
use this method and the magic number '1' to enable this, and '0' to disable it!

getRandomChannel()
this method returns the current magic number status indicating if random channel
selection is currently enabled or disabled

setRCSeed(int seed)
this method seeds the random channel selection, useful if you want to get the same
'randomized' results more than once!
